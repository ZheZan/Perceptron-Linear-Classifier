# Perceptron Linear Classifier

## Overview

A simple single layer perceptron neural network with 3 input layers, 1 hidden layer and 1 output layer.
The perceptron will classify linearly according a linear boundary line and converge to it using a training set of points.

## Technical Info

* The perceptron algorithm is contained in the _Perceptron.py_ class file, with it's inputs being represented by the _Inputs.py_ class.

* The _Run.py_ file contains the run code for a test case of a training/testing set (split 70/30%). It also assumes the linear boundary is given by the function _f(x)_ which models a line of _2x+1_.
